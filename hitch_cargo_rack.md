# hitch cargo rack

I got this one

MaxxHaul 50149 500-lb Capacity 50 inch x 22 inch Hitch Mount Premium Folding Aluminum Cargo Carrier

I think I'll use these Plano trunks on it

I'll also add this jerry can to it

this is how I will secure it and lock them

i used this to weatherproof the plano trunnks
