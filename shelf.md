## history

### prototype shelf

- 2024
  - Nov - the plywood shelf broke at the hingepoint on my first big long road trip.
  - Oct - I added a wood shelf to the rear.
    - measured and cut a scrap piece of plywood to fit in the rear of the 4Runner over the wheel hubs
    - on the left side I cut at one third across and added hinges to match where the single seat folds down
    - small gate hinge x3
    - 2x4 legs x3
      - 2 in center (to the right of the hinges) one on right corner for extra support
    - double zip-tied to each rear seat side-bar C or U lock point
    - mounted 6 walkie talkies on the back right with zip ties
